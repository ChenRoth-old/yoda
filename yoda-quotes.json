  "Fear is the path to the dark side… fear leads to anger… anger leads to hate… hate leads to suffering.",
  "Do. Or do not. There is no try.",
  "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.",
  "Always pass on what you have learned.",
  "Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you."
